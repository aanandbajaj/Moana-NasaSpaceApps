# Moana

MOANA is a web application that helps city governments understand the risk of droughts or floods, and what impact these disasters could have on the local population. Considering 800 million people will live in under-resourced communities by 2050, low-cost water management tools like MOANA are a need.

The software:
+ Identifies nearby waterbodies based on satellite data,
+ Calculates change in sea levels overtime, and
+ Provides a call for action for city officials to re-route water supply if needed
